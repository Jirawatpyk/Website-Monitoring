# Decision log

Decisions that settle a conflict between the PRD and the design spec, or fill a gap in either. Newest first. Code that implements a decision cites its ID.

| ID | Date | Decision | Supersedes |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-004 | 28 Sep 2026 | A site that fails again while its incident is still open re-enters **the same incident** (same thread); escalation keeps its original clock | Gap — PRD §7 flapping rule doesn't say which state |
| D-003 | 28 Sep 2026 | PROBLEM incidents pass through Monitoring and Needs root cause like DOWN, and end at Resolved | Spec §15.4 short PROBLEM path (read as "no In review / Closed") |
| D-002 | 28 Sep 2026 | Client-update track fires when Tier 1 DOWN **reaches** 15 min (`>=`), counted from the first failed check | Spec §16.2 wording "> 15 min" |
| D-001 | 28 Sep 2026 | Blocked + verifier unavailable → **PROBLEM (unverified) at once**, Admin told, retried every round | PRD §5 "keep status, PROBLEM after 10 min" (flowchart, verification spec, test plan) |

## D-004 — Relapse inside an open incident

**Gap.** PRD §7 says one incident = one Chat thread, and flapping (≥ 3 status changes in 30 min) is merged into one incident tagged "flapping" with a single recovery summary after 15 min continuously OK. Neither the PRD nor the spec says what state an incident takes when its site fails again while the incident is in Monitoring or Needs root cause (INC-0133 VOCA dropped 4 times in 52 min).

**Decision.**
- While an incident is open (any state before Resolved), a new PROBLEM/DOWN on the same site joins that incident — no new incident, no new thread. A DOWN relapse on a PROBLEM incident raises its severity to DOWN.
- State on relapse: back to **Acknowledged** if someone had acknowledged it, otherwise back to **Unacked** (or **Escalated · Lx** if a level had fired). The relapse is a timeline event and a thread reply (`DOWN · <site> · down again`), mentioning only whoever is currently expected to act.
- Escalation keeps its **original clock** from the first "Confirmed down"; levels that already fired don't fire again, the next pending one keeps its time. The client-update track and incident duration also keep counting from the first failed check.
- The 3rd change within 30 min tags the incident `is_flapping`; from then on RECOVERED replies are suppressed until 15 min continuously OK, then one summary.

**Why.** Matches the PRD's one-thread rule, doesn't reset anyone's escalation because a site flickered, and reproduces the VOCA sample (one incident, "flapped ×4", 41 min down, acked once). Implemented in S04 (PROBLEM triggers, flapping & status rules) of `docs/implementation-plan.md`.

## D-003 — PROBLEM lifecycle passes through recovery states

**Conflict.** Spec §15.4 lists DOWN as Unacked → Escalated → Acknowledged → Monitoring → Needs root cause → Resolved → In review → Closed, and PROBLEM as "Unacked/Escalated → Acknowledged → Resolved (ends there; no Closed)". The same section says "Resolve needs 3 conditions everywhere: OK for 2 rounds, client update, root cause written."

**Decision.** PROBLEM uses the same states up to Resolved — including Monitoring (first OK round) and Needs root cause (after 2 OK rounds with no root cause) — and never enters In review or Closed. The only shortcut is the < 5 min unacknowledged auto-resolve (spec §16.1).

**Why.** "Resolve needs 3 conditions everywhere" can only hold if a PROBLEM also waits for 2 OK rounds and a root cause, which are exactly Monitoring and Needs root cause. The short PROBLEM line exists to say "no review, no Closed". `transition()` in `packages/engine/src/lifecycle.ts` already behaves this way.

## D-002 — Client-update threshold: `>= 15 min` from the first failed check

**Conflict.** Spec §9 and PRD §8 say the track fires when a Tier 1 DOWN is "reaching 15 min" / "ครบ 15 นาที". Spec §16.2 and the Resolve / StatusModel boards say the client update is required when "Tier 1 DOWN > 15 min".

**Decision.** Fire at exactly 15:00 of incident duration (`>= 15`). The duration is counted from the first failed check, like every incident duration (spec §14.3) — not from "Confirmed down", which only drives the escalation clock. Tier 2 stays `>= 60` min inside response hours.

**Why.**
- The worked example is exact: INC-0142 first failed at 09:48:12 and the client update was due and posted at **10:03:12** — Incident timeline, Audit log and Alert-channels delivery log all show 10:03:12. That is 15:00 after the first failure, so the rule is "reaching", measured from the first failure. Escalation L1 fired separately at 10:03:41 (15 min after confirmed 09:48:41).
- §16.2 defines the resolve condition as "required only if the client-update track fired"; its "> 15 min" paraphrases that trigger, it doesn't define a second threshold. Using `>=` keeps one rule everywhere: the condition is required exactly when the track fired.
- The Tier 2 clause in the same sentence already uses `>=`.

**Impact.** `clientUpdateRequired()` in `packages/engine/src/lifecycle.ts`; the engine must pass minutes since the first failed check. No UI copy changes ("Tier 1 DOWN over 15 min" in help text still reads correctly).

## D-001 — Verifier unavailable while a site is blocked: PROBLEM (unverified) immediately

**Conflict.** PRD §5 (flowchart, verification spec, go-live test plan): keep the current status and alert the Admin; only after > 10 min blocked without verification → PROBLEM (unverified). Design spec §6 canonical DOWN rule ("use it verbatim") and the StatusModel board row "Blocked · verifier unavailable": PROBLEM (unverified) at once — "No proof either way… retried every check", notify Owner + Alerts Space, Admin told about the verifier.

**Decision.** Follow the spec: PROBLEM (unverified) with trigger `blocked_unverified` at once, Admin alerted about the verifier, the monitor keeps retrying every round.

**Why.**
- **Precedence.** Spec §0 says it holds "the rules every screen follows — statuses, escalation, lifecycle", and PRD §14 says the spec wins on behaviour; the PRD keeps scope, priority, architecture and budget. Status logic is behaviour. The spec is also the later document (five review rounds, 28 Sep).
- **Honest status.** "Keep status" usually means keeping **OK** on a site we can't currently see. A WAF 503 can also hide a real outage, so for up to 10 min the dashboard would claim a state nobody verified. The product goal is that no client finds an outage first; showing "unverified" is the truthful state.
- **Noise stays low without the 10-min grace.** PROBLEM never pages the CEO, is held until 09:00 outside Tier 2–3 response hours, and a PROBLEM that clears within 5 min without an ack auto-resolves and is hidden (spec §16.1) — so a quick verifier restart (systemd) produces at most one short, hidden PROBLEM.
- **Clients unaffected.** `blocked_unverified` is internal-only on the status page and in client reports (spec §12).

**Impact.** `decideVerification()` in `packages/engine/src/round.ts` (the `blockedForMin` parameter and the 10-min constant are removed). The Claude Doc PRD was updated on 28 Sep 2026 (rev 142): §5 flowchart node, the browser-verification bullet and the go-live test-plan line now say PROBLEM (unverified) at once; `docs/prd.md` mirrors it.
